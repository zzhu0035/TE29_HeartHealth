It can recommend the most appropriate sports category and mode for users through information such as the user&#x27;s height and weight. And users can choose levels of difficulty to form a personal exercise plan.<br><strong>Dangers of being overweight</strong><br>Overweight means that the weight of an individual is greater than the weight of a normal person or a healthy weight to a certain extent. Being overweight is usually due to fat accumulation in the body. To identify whether an individual is overweight requires reference to the Body Mass Index (BMI). Detailed information can be observed through the website: <br>https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi_tbl.htm<br><strong>The dangers of being overweight</strong><br>(1) Excessive fat accumulation increases circulating blood volume, causing increased heart load and high blood pressure.<br>(2) Abnormal fat metabolism and hyperlipidemia caused by high calorie eating lead to coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial fat deposition, thickening of the ventricular wall, and decreased myocardial compliance.<br>(3) The accompanying increase in blood sugar and blood lipids increases blood viscosity, weakens the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen, and insufficient oxygen supply to myocardial cells.<br>(4) Excessive obesity leads to limited activity, which leads to weakened or insufficient coronary collateral circulation, and decreased cardiac compensatory ability.<br>The incidence of hypertensive heart disease (high heart disease) and coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (coronary heart disease) is high among obese people.<br><strong>Other content related to heart health</strong><br>(1) Early symptoms of a heart attack include tightness or discomfort in the chest, arms, neck, or shoulders. If any of these symptoms occur during exercise, it may be an early warning sign of angina. Angina can cause a heart attack.<br>(2) Heart attacks are not limited to the elderly. A healthy lifestyle and proper exercise can reduce the occurrence of heart problems.<br>(3) Foods that are good for heart health include walnuts, tomatoes, oats, deep-sea fish, black beans and black sesame seeds.</p>
